# [PICPAC](https://github.com/aaalgo/picpac)

PicPac is an image database for deep learning. It efficiently streams samples from disk to deep-learning frameworks (Tensorflow, PyTorch, Caffe, etc) for training, applying format conversion and data augmentation on-the-fly. PicPac allows the user to take a data-centric approach to deep-learning, so that a project is less dependent on the actual framework used. For example, if the training process is developed with PicPac, it only takes minimal efforts to switch from Tensorflow to PyTorch or vice versa.

# [PAPERWORKS](https://github.com/aaalgo/paperworks)

Contour annotation with mouse is tedious and stressful, and annotation precision is usually limited by the size of monitor (even with the help of touch screen and wacom tablets). The aim of this project is to revolutionize contour annotation with a great ancient invention: the paper. The paperwork image annotation process is high-precision, high-throughput and enjoyable.

# [KGRAPH](https://github.com/aaalgo/kgraph) AND [DONKEY](https://github.com/aaalgo/donkey)

KGraph and Donkey for indexing feature data can be compared to Lucene and ElasticSearch for indexing text data. The breakthrough in deep-learning has made it practical to extract feature vectors that measure the similarity between images, audio clips and other sensor data. KGraph and Donkey made it possible to index a large amount of such feature data to conduct efficient similarity search based on the semantics of the indexed data. For example, a similar face search engine can be quickly implemented by plugging in a face detector (PySeeta) and a feature extractor (FaceNet).
